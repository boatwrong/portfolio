        <p>
        A report done on the subject of heat transfer through in fins was completed during the spring of 2021. The work was entitled 
        <i>Geometric thermal analysis of fins with forced convection.</i> The purpose of the study was to investigate the differences
        in heat transfer rates between fins of different geometric shapes. The idea was proposed to determine an optimal shape of fins 
        for compact use cases in order to maximize heat dissipation.
